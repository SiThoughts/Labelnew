# Detailed Technical Proposal: High-Accuracy Micro-Defect Detection System

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a state-of-the-art computer vision system for detecting micro-defects (blisters) on mobile phone backglass components. The system employs a Three-Stage Refinement Pipeline architecture designed to achieve >99% recall and >95% precision on defects as small as 10-50 pixels.

The proposed solution addresses the fundamental challenges of small object detection through specialized model architectures, advanced data augmentation strategies, and a progressive refinement approach that maximizes accuracy while maintaining practical deployment feasibility.

## Problem Definition and Technical Challenges

### Current State Analysis

Manual inspection of phone backglass for micro-defects presents several critical limitations:

**Scale Challenge**: Defects typically measure 10-50 pixels on high-resolution images, representing less than 0.01% of the total image area. Standard object detection models are optimized for objects that occupy 1-10% of the image, making them inherently unsuitable for this application.

**Similarity Challenge**: True defects (blisters) exhibit visual characteristics nearly identical to common contaminants such as dust particles, fiber strands, and print artifacts. This creates an extremely challenging classification problem where false positives are abundant.

**Precision Requirements**: The application demands both high recall (to prevent defective units from reaching customers) and high precision (to avoid scrapping good units). This dual requirement is particularly difficult to achieve with small objects where signal-to-noise ratios are inherently low.

**Variability Factors**: Images exhibit variation in lighting conditions, camera angles, phone orientations, and background elements, all of which can affect detection performance.

### Technical Requirements

The system must achieve the following performance targets:
- **Defect Recall**: >99.0% (miss rate <1%)
- **Detection Precision**: >95.0% (false alarm rate <5%)
- **Segmentation Accuracy**: >70% IoU (Intersection over Union)
- **Processing Speed**: <2 seconds per image
- **ROI Isolation Success**: >99.9%

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

Rather than attempting to solve all challenges with a single monolithic model, we propose a **Three-Stage Refinement Pipeline** where each stage is optimized for a specific subtask. This approach leverages the principle that specialized models typically outperform general-purpose models on focused tasks.

The architecture follows a "coarse-to-fine" progression:
1. **Stage 1**: Robust isolation and standardization of the region of interest
2. **Stage 2**: High-recall detection of all potential defect candidates
3. **Stage 3**: High-precision verification and final segmentation

### Stage 1: ROI Isolation and Normalization

**Objective**: Extract and standardize the phone backglass region to create consistent input for subsequent processing stages.

**Technical Approach**:

The first stage employs a two-step process combining object detection with semantic segmentation:

1. **Coarse Localization**: A lightweight YOLOv8-Small model trained on approximately 500 annotated images provides rapid localization of the phone within the full camera frame. This model operates on downscaled images (640x640) for computational efficiency.

2. **Precise Segmentation**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) receives the coarse bounding box as a prompt and generates a pixel-perfect mask of the backglass. SAM's foundation model capabilities eliminate the need for custom training while providing exceptional segmentation accuracy.

3. **Geometric Normalization**: From the precise mask, we calculate the oriented minimum bounding rectangle and apply perspective transformation to produce a standardized, rectangular image containing only the aligned backglass.

**Key Benefits**:
- Eliminates background noise and distractors
- Standardizes input dimensions and orientation
- Reduces computational load for subsequent stages
- Provides consistent geometric reference frame

### Stage 2: High-Recall Candidate Detection

**Objective**: Identify every possible defect candidate while prioritizing recall over precision.

**Technical Approach**:

This stage employs a modified YOLOv8-Large-Seg architecture with critical enhancements for small object detection:

**Architectural Modifications**:
- **P2 Feature Head Addition**: Standard YOLO architectures detect at strides 8, 16, and 32 (P3, P4, P5 levels). We add a P2 head operating at stride 4, enabling detection of objects as small as 8-16 pixels.
- **High-Resolution Processing**: Input images are processed at 1280x1280 resolution to preserve fine details.

**Adaptive SAHI Strategy**:
Traditional sliding window approaches use uniform tile sizes and overlap patterns. Our adaptive approach optimizes computational resources:

1. **Baseline Pass**: Process the entire image using large tiles (768x768) with 30% overlap for comprehensive coverage.
2. **Hotspot Identification**: Apply classical computer vision techniques (Laplacian of Gaussian, texture analysis) to identify regions with high defect probability.
3. **Focused Re-analysis**: Apply smaller tiles (512x512) with increased overlap (45%) specifically to hotspot regions.

**Training Strategy**:
- **Low Confidence Threshold**: Models are trained and deployed with very low confidence thresholds (0.05) to maximize recall.
- **Advanced Augmentation**: Extensive use of Mosaic, MixUp, and copy-paste augmentation using a curated library of defect patches.
- **Loss Function Optimization**: Weighted loss functions that penalize missed small objects more heavily than false positives.

### Stage 3: Precision Verification and Refinement

**Objective**: Filter false positives from Stage 2 candidates and generate precise segmentation masks for verified defects.

**Technical Approach**:

A lightweight U-Net architecture specifically designed for binary classification and segmentation of small image patches:

**Model Architecture**:
- **Input**: 128x128 pixel crops centered on each candidate from Stage 2
- **Architecture**: Shallow U-Net with 3 encoder/decoder levels and channel progression [16, 32, 64]
- **Output**: Binary segmentation mask indicating defect presence and precise boundaries

**Training Data Generation**:
The training dataset for this stage is generated by running the Stage 2 model on all available images and manually classifying the results:
- **Positive Examples**: Crops where Stage 2 predictions overlap with ground truth (IoU > 0.5)
- **Negative Examples**: Crops where Stage 2 predictions are false positives
- **Dataset Balance**: Approximately 5,000 positive and 5,000 negative examples

**Loss Function Design**:
A combined loss function optimizes both classification accuracy and segmentation quality:
- **Dice Loss Component (70%)**: Optimizes mask shape and handles class imbalance
- **Binary Cross-Entropy Component (30%)**: Provides stable classification gradients

**Decision Logic**:
- Candidates producing non-empty masks above threshold are accepted as true defects
- Final bounding boxes are calculated from refined masks
- Coordinates are transformed back to original image space

## Data Strategy and Requirements

### Dataset Specifications

**Image Collection Requirements**:
- **Minimum Volume**: 2,000 high-resolution images
- **Defect Coverage**: All known defect types, sizes, and locations
- **Environmental Variation**: Multiple lighting conditions, camera angles, and backgrounds

- **Defect Annotations**: Pixel-perfect segmentation masks for all defects
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-annotator validation with >95% agreement threshold
- **Format**: COCO or YOLO segmentation format for compatibility

### Advanced Data Augmentation

**Defect Library Creation**:
A curated library of 300+ high-quality defect patches with transparent backgrounds enables sophisticated copy-paste augmentation. These patches are extracted from real defects and processed to remove background elements.

**Augmentation Techniques**:
- **Copy-Paste with Poisson Blending**: Realistic integration of defect patches onto clean surfaces
- **Geometric Transformations**: Rotation, scaling, and perspective changes
- **Photometric Variations**: Brightness, contrast, and color adjustments
- **Synthetic Hard Negatives**: Programmatic addition of dust, fibers, and artifacts
