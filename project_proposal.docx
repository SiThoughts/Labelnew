Subject: Proposal for a High-Accuracy Computer Vision System for Micro-Defect Detection

### 1.0 Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive project plan to develop and implement a state-of-the-art computer vision system for the automated detection, segmentation, and analysis of micro-defects (commonly known as "blisters") on mobile phone backglass components. The current industry challenge lies in reliably identifying extremely small defects (in the 10-50 pixel range) while maintaining a low false positive rate, a task that is difficult to scale with manual inspection.

To address this, I propose a **Three-Stage Refinement Pipeline**. This strategy is architected for maximum accuracy by decoupling the problem into three specialized tasks: robustly isolating the region of interest (ROI), conducting a high-recall search for all potential defect candidates, and finally, using a high-precision verification model to eliminate false positives and finalize results.

This project will proceed through four distinct phases: (1) Data Foundation, (2) Model Development, (3) Pipeline Integration & Validation, and (4) Finalization & Handover. The final deliverable will be a fully validated system that provides a precise bounding box, a pixel-perfect segmentation mask, and a confidence score for every detected defect, establishing a new benchmark for quality control.

### 2.0 Project Goal and Objectives

**Primary Goal:** To develop an automated system that achieves >99% recall and >95% precision in detecting micro-defects on phone backglass, effectively eliminating manual inspection bottlenecks and improving quality assurance consistency.

**Key Objectives:**

*   **Objective 1:** To create a robust and scalable dataset, including a comprehensive library of defect variations and "hard negative" examples.
*   **Objective 2:** To develop and train a cascade of specialized machine learning models, each optimized for a specific task within the detection pipeline.
*   **Objective 3:** To integrate these models into a cohesive, end-to-end system capable of processing a raw image and outputting a structured list of verified defects.
*   **Objective 4:** To rigorously benchmark the system's performance and establish a clear process for future maintenance and iterative improvement.

### 3.0 Proposed Solution: The Three-Stage Refinement Pipeline

The core of this proposal is a sophisticated "coarse-to-fine" methodology. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic model, we will build a pipeline where each stage has a clear and distinct responsibility.

*   **Stage 1: Robust ROI Isolation & Normalization**
    *   **Problem:** Raw images contain distracting backgrounds and inconsistent camera angles, which introduce noise and variability.
    *   **Solution:** We will first use a lightweight object detector (YOLOv8-S) to find the phone's general location. This location is then passed as a prompt to a Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate a pixel-perfect mask of the backglass. From this mask, we compute the oriented bounding box, allowing us to rotate and crop the image.
    *   **Outcome:** A perfectly aligned, rectangular image containing *only* the backglass. This standardization is critical for the accuracy of all subsequent stages.

*   **Stage 2: High-Recall Candidate Search**
    *   **Problem:** Tiny defects are easily missed. A standard detector tuned for precision might ignore them entirely.
    *   **Solution:** We will employ a powerful YOLOv8-Large-Seg model with a crucial architectural modification: the inclusion of a **P2 feature head**. This enables the model to make detections at a stride of 4, making it exceptionally sensitive to objects as small as 8-16 pixels. We will use an Adaptive SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) strategy, which applies smaller, higher-overlap tiles in regions where defects are more likely to hide. This stage is intentionally tuned with a low confidence threshold to find *every possible candidate*, prioritizing recall above all else.
    *   **Outcome:** A list of defect candidates with high recall but containing an expected number of false positives.

*   **Stage 3: High-Precision Verification & Refinement**
    *   **Problem:** The candidate list from Stage 2 is noisy. We need to filter out false positives (dust, print artifacts, reflections) without discarding true defects.
    *   **Solution:** Each candidate is subjected to scrutiny by a small, specialized **Refiner U-Net**. This model is trained exclusively on small (e.g., 128x128) image crops of "true defects" and "hard negatives." Its sole job is to act as an expert classifier and segmenter. If the model determines a candidate is a true defect, it outputs a clean, refined mask; otherwise, it outputs an empty mask, and the candidate is discarded.
    *   **Outcome:** A final, clean list of verified defects, each with a precise segmentation mask and a corresponding bounding box.

#### **Phase 1: Data Foundation & Asset Creation (Weeks 1-4)**

The success of this entire project hinges on the quality and scale of our dataset.

*   **Activity 1.1: Environment Setup:**
    *   **Task:** Provision a development server with a high-VRAM GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A6000/RTX 4090). Install CUDA, cuDNN, and a version-controlled Python environment with PyTorch, OpenCV, and other required libraries.
    *   **Deliverable:** A fully functional and documented development environment.
*   **Activity 1.2: Image Acquisition & Curation:**
    *   **Task:** Collect a minimum of 2,000 high-resolution images under controlled lighting conditions. The image set must be diverse, covering all known defect types, sizes, and locations, as well as pristine units and units with known "confusers" (dust, fibers, etc.).
    *   **Deliverable:** A curated image corpus, organized and versioned.

        2.  **Defect Annotation:** Draw pixel-perfect segmentation masks for every defect on all 2,000+ images. This is the "ground truth" and requires extreme attention to detail.
    *   **Deliverable:** A complete, versioned annotation dataset in COCO or YOLO format.
*   **Activity 1.4: Defect Augmentation Library:**
    *   **Task:** Manually crop at least 300 high-quality examples of true defects. For each, create a PNG patch with a transparent background (alpha channel).
